		<p>You have a role as an individual.  At 9:30 am, I went to the blackboard and wrote down our understanding of the bank's interests.  In line management, each superior manager is the direct superior of all inferior personnel, and all inferior employees are considered his subordinates.The closest direct supervisor is called the immediate supervisor.  They put this hatred at the center of their adult life and live according to a reactive scenario corresponding to this hatred.  They went to the heads of various departments, such as the accounting department, and said something like this: - Sir, I am participating in a new experimental program called student-led learning.  Indeed, without education in our world you cannot go far. </p>

		<p>Imagine that you are going to the funeral of a loved one.  Further, when we open in ourselves and begin to use our imagination and an independent will to action - we make promises, set goals and follow them - we create a monolith of our character - our being, making possible all subsequent positive phenomena in our life.  The paradigm of determinism is the result of studying the behavior of animals - rats, monkeys, pigeons, dogs - as well as people with abnormalities in the nervous or mental system.  As a result, managers have compiled a list of over a hundred goals.  Before raising an issue, before evaluating and prescribing, before expressing your ideas - strive to understand. </p>

		<p>The left operates with words, the right with images; the left one deals with parts and features, the right one deals with the whole and the connections between separate parts.  Instead of trying to change him, we tried to look from the outside - to separate ourselves from him, to feel his personality, individuality and dignity.  If I am emotionally dependent, then my sense of dignity and self-confidence depends on your opinion of me.  Love-feeling can be returned by love-action.  We must exercise common sense when designing our exercise program.  Therefore, the real price almost always deviates from the value,but value always remains the middle position around which prices fluctuate.  We drove slowly for about an hour, quietly talking to each other.  Many people, whether they are familiar with the idea of ​​Square II or not, understand the importance for their lives of actions that belong to this square.  They are smart, value-driven, versed in reality and know what to do.  This is the gestalt, the wholeness of your personality.  I achieved the greatest success in my teaching activity at the university then,when, in the spirit of “Win ​​/ Win”, I achieved a common understanding with the students of the goal of our joint work: - This is what we want to accomplish. </p>

It is listed sequentially in the book and, at the end of each skill description,is provided with how-tos so you can take a closer look at any of the skills individually whenever you want.  As more firms enter the industry, the supply curve will shift to the right.  This person made a huge contribution to the Emotional Banking Account by providing psychological oxygen to his partner.  It could all end well.  The price seemed too high to him.Another friend of mine, a university teacher, was willing to pay such a high price.  CONCEPT OF PHYSICAL CAPITAL AND ITS COMPOSITION Physical capital is a durable production factor (fixed capital), it has been involved in production for many years.  You can adapt to new conditions and be flexible.  It means success in effective interaction, bringing mutually beneficial results to each of its participants.  We go back to the right brain and use imagination, creativity, conscience and inspiration.  It was obvious that the total depletion of the Emotional Bank Account was creating a culture of low trust.  Moreover, each firm seeks to obtain the greatest possible profit from its activities. </p>
