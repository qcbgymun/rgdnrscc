		<p>Proactive people are driven by values ​​- carefully thought out, selected and accepted.  However, without a foundation of principles and a formulated personal mission, they will not have the necessary foundation for long-term success.  LABOR FORCE In the market conditions of the functioning of the economy, labor is the subject of purchase and sale.  This principle is easy to understand by remembering Aesop's fable about the goose and the golden eggs.  Understanding how your essence affects each interdependent interaction will help you direct your efforts consistently and in harmony with the natural laws of development.  Goal management was conceived as a constantly operating system for defining specific goals (end results) for each employee's day. </p>
